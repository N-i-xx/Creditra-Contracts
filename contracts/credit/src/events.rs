//! # Event Types, Topic Constants, and Publishers for the Credit Contract
//!
//! ## Stable Event Schema
//!
//! All events emitted by this contract follow a frozen topic structure that
//! indexers and analytics pipelines can rely on without version negotiation.
//!
//! ### Topic layout
//!
//! Every event topic is a two-element tuple:
//!
//! ```text
//! (namespace: Symbol, qualifier: Symbol | Address)
//! ```
//!
//! The first element is always one of the four namespace constants defined
//! below.  The second element is either a sub-action symbol (lifecycle events)
//! or the borrower's `Address` (financial events), giving indexers a direct
//! filter key without decoding the data payload.
//!
//! ### Trust boundary
//!
//! Indexers **must** verify the emitting contract ID before trusting event
//! content.  Any contract can publish events with the same topic structure;
//! the contract address is the authoritative identity, not the topic symbols.
//!
//! ### Address authorization
//!
//! `Address` objects that appear in topics are always the borrower address
//! that was authenticated by `require_auth()` earlier in the same call frame.
//! They are never caller-supplied without prior auth.
